                 After we both started building games and apps, Dan invited me to learn HTML \ CCS with him so I decided to join him.
                  My other hobbies are playing the computer, playing basketball.
                 In the future, I want to be a full stack software developer.</p>

        </p><p id = "desc"><strong>The story behind YD</strong> is very interesting.<br/>
        It all started when we both were interested about Drop Shipping in eBay.
         After learning about selling from the internet, we opened our eBay business (YD - Express Sells)
          and we sold a few products and made our first revenue. At the same time, Yarin already knew Python and he
        , invited Dan to learn. After we both learned deeper and GUI's, we started developing our games.
        Recently, we decided to start building websites with HTML \ CCS.
        In the future as a company, we are planning to build websites for other businesses,
        learn more langueches like Java in high school, C#, Unity, SQL, JavaScript and more. </p> <a href="https://github.com/YD-Coding/" target="_blank">

                then, I started learning HTML and CSS and Yarin joined me. Except coding I have more hobbies like playing basketball, guitar and piano.
                I played for the Israel basketball national team last year.
                My dream like I have already mentioned is to be a game and software developer.</p>
