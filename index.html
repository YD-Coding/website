                 After we both started building games and apps, Dan invited me to learn HTML \ CCS with him so I decided to join him.
                  My other hobbies are playing the computer, playing basketball.

        It all started when we both were interested about Drop Shipping in eBay.
         After learning about selling from the internet, we opened our eBay business (YD - Express Sells)
          and we sold a few products and made our first revenue. At the same time, Yarin already knew Python and he
        , invited Dan to learn. After we both learned deeper and GUI's, we started developing our games.
        Recently, we decided to start building websites with HTML \ CCS.
        In the future as a company, we are planning to build websites for other businesses,
        learn more langueches like Java in high school, C#, Unity, SQL, JavaScript and more. </p> <a href="https://github.com/YD-Coding/" target="_blank">

                then, I started learning HTML and CSS and Yarin joined me. Except coding I have more hobbies like playing basketball, guitar and piano.
                I played for the Israel basketball national team last year.
                My dream like I have already mentioned is to be a game and software developer.</p>
